# Github @ bbv

Over the last few years GitHub has become one of the major plattforms for interaction between technically-minded people. As such it should be considered more than just a data-dump for git repsitories and be treated like any other social media plattform. This is especially true if one makes use of the github.io plattform for git-based blogging. At bbv we are actively advertising good software crafmanship on all levels ranging from using CleanCode over providing simple build toolchains to encouraging developer-friendly and efficient workflow. Because of this this values and techniques should be part of our natural way of working and thus be reflected in the work we publish over github. 
This document serves as a guide and base standard to setup and maintain repositories for bbv on github.
